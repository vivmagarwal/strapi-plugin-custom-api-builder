# Strapi Custom API Builder plugin

Design your custom API's (or custom reports / or custom views) directly from the [Strapi CMS](https://github.com/strapi/strapi) admin panel. Simply select the fields you need to show, enter a valid slug and let the plugin magically create the routes, controllers & services for you. Very easy to create & even easier to maintain.

## ‚è≥ Installation

Install Strapi with this **Quickstart** command to create a Strapi project instantly:

- (Use **yarn** to install the Strapi project (recommended). [Install yarn with these docs](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/).)

```bash
# with yarn
yarn create strapi-app my-project --quickstart

# with npm/npx
npx create-strapi-app my-project --quickstart
```

_This command generates a brand new project with the default features (authentication, permissions, content management, content type builder & file upload). The **Quickstart** command installs Strapi using a **SQLite** database which is used for prototyping in development._

### üì¶ Install the plugin

```bash
yarn add strapi-plugin-custom-api@latest

# or

npm i -S strapi-plugin-custom-api@latest
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: Install required dependencies

**For Strapi v5 compatibility, you MUST also install these dependencies:**

```bash
yarn add lodash @strapi/design-system @strapi/icons

# or

npm install lodash @strapi/design-system @strapi/icons
```

**Why these dependencies are needed:**
- `lodash`: Plugin uses lodash utilities (upperFirst, cloneDeepWith, cloneDeep)
- `@strapi/design-system`: UI components for the admin interface  
- `@strapi/icons`: Icon components for navigation and UI

**Without these dependencies, the plugin will not work properly in Strapi v5.**

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configure the plugin

Add the following config to `/config/plugins.js` file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  "custom-api": {
    enabled: true,
  },
};
```

**Note:** If you don't have a `plugins.js` file, create one in your `/config/` directory.


### üöÄ Start your application

After successful installation, build and start your Strapi application:

```bash
yarn build && yarn develop

# or

npm run build && npm run develop
```

For development with automatic admin rebuilding:

```bash
yarn develop --watch-admin

# or

npm run develop --watch-admin
```

The **Custom API Builder** plugin should appear in the **Plugins** section of Strapi sidebar after you restart your app.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Plugin not loading?
1. **Check dependencies**: Ensure you've installed `lodash`, `@strapi/design-system`, and `@strapi/icons`
2. **Clear cache**: Delete `node_modules/.cache` and rebuild
3. **Check configuration**: Verify `plugins.js` is configured correctly
4. **Console errors**: Check browser console for specific error messages

### Common issues:
- **"Cannot resolve @strapi/design-system"**: Install the missing dependency
- **"Plugin not found"**: Verify the plugin is listed in your `package.json`
- **"Admin won't build"**: Clear cache and rebuild with `--watch-admin`

For more detailed troubleshooting, see `CLAUDE_CODE_GUIDE.md`.
